      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;mixmaster&#34;&gt;MixMaster&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i like mmorpgs, they are fun to play and every time i play i respect the game more when i think about the technical stuff behind it as a developer. because of that i try every mmorpg i can find from different years good or bad. mixmaster is one of them. i never played it before, i dont even know what it is, and i started downloading it. the info i found about the game and the company was not the same as the info in the launcher, so i started thinking maybe this is a private server, maybe not. now lets start the game from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi. I am a C and C++ developer and freelancer. I worked on MMORPG game mods for many years. My skills are reverse engineering, Windows internals, Windows kernel development, OS development, and game security. I also use JavaScript. I enjoy game engines, optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
